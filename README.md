# README Generator

This project was made in node.js using Javascript. When the script is ran from the terminal, a series of questions are asked to fill out the README and place info in each category. The generated README includes the following sections: 

  * Title
  * Description
  * Table of Contents (with clickable links to each section)
  * Installation
  * Usage
  * License (with badge)
  * Contributions
  * Tests
  * Questions (with links to email and the user's Github)

  If a section is left blank on the generator, the section will not be generated, same with the License section if "none" is chosen on the list. Once the generator reaches the end of the script, it will let the user know as well as print out a link to my email if they have any questions about the application.
